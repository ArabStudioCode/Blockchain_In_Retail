## Introduction

The retail industry faces many challenges, including trust issues, transaction transparency, and loyalty program management. Our project aims to address these issues by leveraging blockchain technology. By using Ethereum smart contracts, we ensure that all transactions are recorded immutably. This approach fosters trust among users and provides a seamless experience in managing loyalty points.

## Features

- **Automated Loyalty Awarding**: Customers earn loyalty points automatically based on their purchases.
- **Point Redemption**: Customers can redeem points for discounts or rewards easily.
- **Real-time Currency Conversion**: The system converts Indian Rupees (INR) to Wei, ensuring accurate transactions.
- **Decentralized Architecture**: The system operates on a decentralized network, enhancing security and transparency.
- **User-Friendly API**: Built with FastAPI, the API is straightforward and easy to integrate.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes a variety of technologies to deliver its features effectively:

- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **Ethereum**: A decentralized platform that enables smart contracts.
- **Solidity**: The programming language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum.
- **Web3.py**: A Python library for interacting with Ethereum.
- **Ganache**: A personal Ethereum blockchain for development and testing.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for easy deployment and scalability.
