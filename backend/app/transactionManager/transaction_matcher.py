    """
    Placeholder function to match an off-chain transaction ID
    to an on-chain transaction ID.

    In a real system, this would involve a database lookup,
    or a more complex logic to verify and link off-chain payment
    references (e.g., from a payment gateway) to the blockchain
    transaction records.

    For this demonstration, we assume a direct mapping or that
    the off-chain system somehow provides the on-chain ID.
    If the off-chain system doesn't provide it, you might need
    to query the blockchain for recent transactions by a specific
    customer/retailer and amount.
